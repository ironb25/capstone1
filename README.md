# Stroke Data Modeling


##  Sections:   

-   Exploratory data Analysis.
-   Correlation Analysis:
    *   Continuous values correlation.(e.g. bmi and age)
    *   Categorical and continuous value correlation.(e.g Stroke and age)
    *   Categorical vs Categeorical correlation.(e.g. Stroke and heart disease)
-   Hypothesis tesing (frequentist way)- : Comparing clinical features :
    *   stroke vs no stroke,
    *    heart disease vs no heart disease,
    *   hypertension vs no hypertension.

-   Hypothesis Testing (Frequentist way): Rate of Stroke between heart disease and no heart disease.
-   Bayesian Inference (Finding Posteriors of Rate of   *  Stroke for heart disease vs no heart disease).
-   Bayesian Hypothesis Testing : Rate of Stroke if you have heart disease vs not.
-   Bayesian Hypothesis Testing : Rate of Stroke for Males vs Females.
-   Finding Top Risk factors of Stroke through Bayesian Inference.

## Background:  


-    Stroke is one of the leading causes of death in the United States.
-   This happens when blood flowing to a part of the brain stops.
-   Some of the risk factors of Stroke include age, heart disease, hypertension, diabetes.
 -  We will explore these risk factors, compare them and eventually identify top risk factors for stroke.
