# Stroke Data Modeling


##  Sections:   

-   Exploratory data Analysis.
-   Correlation Analysis:
    *   Continuous values correlation.(e.g. bmi and age)
    *   Categorical and continuous value correlation.(e.g Stroke and age)
    *   Categorical vs Categeorical correlation.(e.g. Stroke and heart disease)
-   Hypothesis tesing (frequentist way)- : Comparing clinical features :
    *   stroke vs no stroke.
    *   heart disease vs no heart disease.


-   Hypothesis Testing (Frequentist way): Rate of Stroke between heart disease and no heart disease.
-   Bayesian Inference (Finding Posteriors of Rate of   Stroke for heart disease vs no heart disease).
-   Bayesian Hypothesis Testing : Rate of Stroke if you have heart disease vs not.
-   Bayesian Hypothesis Testing : Rate of Stroke for Males vs Females.
-   Finding Top Risk factors of Stroke through Bayesian Inference.

## Background:  


-    Stroke is one of the leading causes of death in the United States.
-   This happens when blood flowing to a part of the brain stops.
-   Some of the risk factors of Stroke include age, heart disease, hypertension, diabetes.
 -  We will explore these risk factors, compare them and eventually identify top risk factors for stroke.

## Distribution of clinical features:

### Categorical Features

### Continuous Features

### Binary features(0 or 1)

## Correlation Analysis

### Correlation between continuous value features

- Comparison of clinical features Age,BMI and Avg glucose levels

### categorical vs continuous correlation

-   Like all correlation analyses the Point-Biserial Correlation measures the strength of association or co-occurrence between two variables. (categorical vs continuous)
- e.g.  indicates a positive relationship between the math score and passing the final exam or failing it. 
- We correlated stroke and heart disease which are categorical features to age.

    ```
    stats.pointbiserialr(df['stroke'].astype(int), df['age'])
    ``` 
    ```
    stats.pointbiserialr(df['heart_disease'].astype(int), df['age']) ```
- We got statistically significant p-value <.0001 for both cases implying both stroke and heart disease have strong association.

## Hypothesis Testing

### Comparing BMI, Age and Average Glucose levels with Stroke and No Stroke using Data distribution

Further, we used Central Limit theorem to plot normal distribution of population means of bmi, age and average glucose levels.

### Comparing BMI, Age and Average Glucose levels with Heart disease and No heart disease using Data distribution

#### Further, we used Central Limit theorem to plot normal distribution of population means of bmi, age and average glucose levels for Heart disease and no heart disease

## Hypothesis Testing (Frequentist way): Rate of Stroke between heart disease and no heart disease.


-   To compare rate of stroke, we performed two sample independent t-test between males and females.

-   The difference in rate of stroke between males and females was not significant with p-value to be 0.630

## Bayesian Inference (Finding Posteriors of Rate of   Stroke for heart disease vs no heart disease)

### Bayesian Approach

-   We made the following assumptions to perform bayesian inference:
-   Rate of stroke is ~ Beta(number of stroke individuals, number of non stroke).
-   Likelihood is assumed to be binomial distribution (stroke or not).
-   Our prior can be modeled as beta and posterior is  beta conjugate prior.
-   This allows us to use beta-binomial distribution.
fitted two posterior distributions of Rate of Stroke(for heart disease individuals vs no heart disease).

Once we have two posterior distributions, we can do hypothesis testing.With bayes hypothesis testing way, we check how probable it is that the parameter p of one site is better than the another.

#### Interpretation from above analysis after hypothesis testing : It is 100% likely that you have a higher probability of having a stroke if you have heart diseaseÂ¶


## Bayesian Hypothesis Testing (Finding Posteriors of Rate of Stroke for Males and Females)

![bayesmalefemale](https://github.com/ironb25/capstone1/blob/main/images/Bayes_Male_vsfemale.png)

#### Interpretation : It is 74% likely that you have a higher probability of having stroke if you are a male. 

## Finding Top Risk Factors

- took positive samples for each of the individual risk factors.

- fitted a posterior distribution for each of them.
